            I enjoy being creative in whatever manner I can.<br>
            <br>
            I started young with drawing and moved from crayons to pencils at an early age, possibly due to a disagreement with my parents over using the walls as my canvas. <br>
            I was incorporating my terrible sense of humour into drawings by age four and blending colour paints, on my brother's face, by age six.<br>
            <br>
            By this age I'd started school and discovered my favourite creative subject: Maths, (yes, you read that correctly.) a subject which, much like myself, shared a lack of concern for reality.<br>
            I would set out with my small toolkit of logic into a world of puzzles, solving each in my own way. <br>
            <br>
            By age nine, I discovered my drawings could move! I had to animate them first but I caught them, those cheeky rascals.<br>
            <br>
            It took a lot of training from this point on, but I finally levelled up Maths enough for it to evolve.<br>
            Maths evolved into.... Programming!<br>
            Now my drawings don't simply move, they're alive! ALIVE!<br>
            <br>
            I could not ask for a more satisfying skill to add to my already eclectic (read: eccentric) set of hobbies. <br>
            <br>
            Who knows what I'll add next...<small>I do but I'm not telling.</small>
